    > A column with `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column, is an alias of the rowid.  
    > If `rowid` value is not specified (or `NULL`is specified) while inserting a new row, SQLite automatically assigns the next sequential integer, which is one larger than the largest rowid in the table. The rowid value starts at `1`.
